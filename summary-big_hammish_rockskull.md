I was born Erky Namfoodle Roondar Boddyknock Warryn Sindri Scheppen, although most people in town just called me Swarf, into a gnome clan in the central foothills of the Dunrock Mountains near the eastern end of the Savalirwood. My father Crampernap is a talented and well-respected tinker who specializes in music boxes. He met my mother back in Hupperdook when she came into his shop looking to buy one. Being a singer with a troupe of minstrels by profession, she wasn't particularly well-off, despite being quite talented. Her troupe was on tour, currently performing at the Scanlan Song Inn.

At the time, my father was a kind man, and single at that. He jokingly offered to give her the one that she wanted if she would let him buy her dinner. To his great surprise, she accepted. My father was already besotted by the end of dinner, so not only did he keep his word, but he also made her a custom box that played her favorite song. Their courtship went on for a while, Da going along with the troupe in their travels, and after a year or so were married. My sister Abalaba was born about a year and a half later. 

After Abbly was born, Da wanted to settle down, saying that the road is no place to raise a child. Reluctantly, Ma agreed, and they bought a home in Forest’s Brightening, a tiny gnome village nestled in the Dunrock Mountains foothills at the very eastern tip of the Savalirwood. Da set up shop and Ma started singing in the inn. I was born there about five years later. While she stayed in Forest’s Brightening, Ma missed being on the road, so when the local minstrel troupe The Shrunken Rooster returned home from touring and asked her to join, she jumped at the chance.

Ma’s job as a singer meant that she was on the road a lot, often 6-8 months a year, but she took a couple of years off after each of us were born since Da was clearly unsuited to caring for such young children. For such a talented and meticulous craftsman, you'd think that he would be more capable of taking care of us, but in reality, he was only marginally able to care for himself. 

Ma traveled a lot more in the years following her times off, having to do so to rebuild her following. Da started getting jealous and suspicious that Ma was cheating on him while touring after I was born. Even as an infant, I was already much bigger than “normal” gnome children were. Since neither Ma nor Da was tall, and Da was in fact considered on the short side in our community, Da saw my height as proof that Ma was unfaithful. When she resumed touring with the troupe after I was old enough, Da started drinking more, which didn’t reduce his suspicions or jealousy. Once we were old enough for the road, she would take Abbly and/or me along. 

I practically lived in Da’s shop when Ma was away. I played with his tools and what bits of scrap were left (Da was so meticulous and stingy that he tried hard to minimize waste, carefully planning cuts from stock to get as many parts from it as possible). Despite his doubts about my origins, I showed a knack for his family’s trade. By my teens, it became obvious that he was grooming me to be his successor, the fifth generation to run the Scheppen music box business. Between the tours and the music boxes, I developed a love of music of any form even though I’d failed at learning almost every instrument, the single exception being the horsehead fiddle used by the nomadic tribes of the northern plains. I tried to become a singer like Ma, but I never was able to progress. I have a good ear and can carry a tune, but my voice is rough, almost grating. Unfortunately, this is a characteristic I haven’t been able to train away to this day. Abbly faired better, though, becoming a talented fiddler and a wonderful dancer. For the time, at least, my path lead towards continuing in Da’s footsteps.

Ten years after I was born, my brother Jabbel was born, much to everyone’s surprise. This was the straw that broke the auroch’s back for Da. While Jabbel was normal size, his eyes were a piercing sapphire blue rather than the emerald greens that dominated our family line. This was proof that Ma was “stepping out” when she stepped out the door for her “tours” with the troupe. While he originally suspected her affair was with Aleslosh Timber, the attractive drummer with the troupe who is 4’ tall, no one in the troupe has blue eyes. In his drunken state, this was proof that she was a trollop who bedded different men in every town she played.

Before she was to leave on her first tour after Jabbel’s birth, Da confronted her with his suspicions, drunk and in a foul mood. She (justly) protested her innocence, saying over and over that she loved only him and that the thought of cheating had never, EVER even fleetingly entered her mind. Furthermore, Aleslosh was secretly gay, so he wouldn’t have been interested in her, to begin with. In fact, he and the piper Raulnor were romantically involved, openly so on the road when away from prying, disapproving eyes.

Da was unswayed. If anything, her protests of innocence and professions of love pissed him off more. Even overwhelmed by rage as he was, such was his personality that he wouldn’t even raise a hand as if to strike a person. This didn’t apply to things, though. He picked up the first music box he had made for her while courting and threw it into the fireplace, shattering it to pieces, the wooden ones being quickly consumed by flame. The heat of the fire melted the rest into globs or twisted them into unrecognizable shapes, rendering the thing completely, irrevocably unrepairable. Alas, the effect on Ma’s love was the same. Sobbing, she packed her things and ran off to her sister’s.

From that point on, Ma spent all her time touring, alone when the troupe was on a break. She never returned to Forest’s Brightening, or to any of the villages nearby.

Througout all of this, I had become more attached to Ma than Da. Sure, he was a kind man and a talented craftsman, our personalities never quite meshed. He had put down deep roots and had no thoughts of leaving our village, even briefly. For me, though, touring with Ma had infected me with wanderlust. There was a whole world out there beyound our hills, a world filled with people, places, and creatures I couldn’t dream of. In our travels, we met elves, dwarves, orcs, and the occasional human, all of whom had stories of far away places of wonder and excitement for a young gnome.

I stayed “home” with Da for a while, but planned in secret to strike out in search of Ma. I worked in the shop during the day and spent my evenings finding seasoned adventurers willing to teach me skills to survive, alone if need be, while on my quest. When none were around, I snuck back into the shop and worked on a special project: two copies of the destroyed music box, one for Ma and one for me. Da’s shop was the perfect place to work with it’s ample supply of materials and large collection of tools. It took me a couple yearsbefore I’d completed the boxes and learned what I felt was enough about survival. I used my savings to purchase basic adventuring gear, a short sword, a bow, and a bunch of arrows, left a note for Da explaining that I’d left and payment for the materials I’d used, and struck out to find Ma.

I am a folk hero because I always stand up for those who are weaker than I am.

I became a barbarian because I went on a (spiritual?) journey to find myself and instead found a spirit animal to guide, protect, and inspire me.

Alternate 1: while roaming the plains, I was struck by lightning. A tribe of barbarians found me unconscious. Impressed that I’d survived, they allowed me to join their tribe. The lightning struck my head, leaving a jagged scar running down from my right temple, across my eye and my mouth. The right eye developed a milky haze, although I didn't lose any sight there. I also "earned" a tree-like lightning scar on my chest. My tribal name is a combination of a joke (Big Hammish) and admiration (Rockskull, for surviving being struck in the head). With my tribe, we migrated east across the Rime Plains to the city of Borofkrah. Given the importance of tattoos there, my fellow barbarians and I got some. In addition to the sleeve tattoo on my left arm, I got a large, forked lightning bolt that covers my whole back.

Even though my tribe is nomadic, my wanderlust and drive to help those weaker than me keeps me moving. I do find the tribe again a few times a year to feel the comforts of home and catch up with friends and loved ones. The rest of the time, I roamed the Wildlands helping out those I can. Sometimes, it's as simple as helping build shelters or taking down a bear or wolf that's been harrying the people or their flocks. Other times, particularly when I visit the southern slopes of the Alps, I defend people from the ravaging bands of wild orcs that plague the region.

On one occasion, I ventured farther north along the edge of the Alps and joined up with Tana Shanil Duvamil Oda Nyx Daergel, an attractive gnome warlock intent on raiding the hoard of Gelidon, the ancient white dragon living in the region. With so few people nearby, I joined up with her to lend a hand (and my axe). We traveled together for a couple of months and became quite close. For a time, I thought we'd be wedded after our adventure. Those were some fine days.

Eventually, we reached the dragon's lair. Knowing that an encounter with an ancient dragon would end one or both of our lives, we looked for excuses to delay. At first, we looked for local people with an eye towards intelligence gathering. When we stopped getting new information, we turned to dealing with some wild orcs who plagued the region, and then hunting to provide food to the needy, and finally building up our own food reserves.

Eventually, we could come up with no more even remotely plausible excuses. We had hoped that Gelidon would leave her lair to hunt, but had no such luck. The local legends (such as they were, gleaned from the few people we encountered) said the dragoness was consumed by a foul mood. She was particularly angry at any males she encountered, apparently the result of a lost love in the past. With that information, Axxxxx and I chose to sneak in to sample the hoard.

We got in and filled our packs, but getting in was the easy part. We nearly made it out, but on our way, one of the packs I was carrying slipped in my hand, alerting Gelidon to our presence. We battled valiantly, but the two of us alone were no match. Axxxxx barely escaped with her life, let alone any of the treasure she wanted, but I was captured. I was held by Gelidon for months, all the while she complained ceaselessly about Vorugal, her former lover, the inconstancy of men, and the isolation of living so far in the north.

Eventually, a brash, young halfling named Roscoe Thorngage arrived in search of fortune and fame. Being a good-hearted lad, he chose to forego his fortune, aiding my escape instead. Needless to say, we became great friends. While both of us were still infected with wanderlust when our paths cross we fall in together for a while and carry on as if no time had passed. We have sworn to each other that once we've gotten enough experience and found some trustworthy allies, we will return to the north to battle Gelidon, he for his delayed fortune and I for my revenge.

I have encountered Axxxxx again twice in my travels. She still bears the scars on her arm from our battle with Galidon and in her heart for my "betrayal" in the cave. The first such encounter, I attempted to placate her and rekindle her affection, as my love for her flamed afresh upon finding her alive, but so vengeful was she that my apologies and explanations were rebuffed. My flames were doused by the icy hatred of me that she'd built over the years. The second time, the fight would have been deadly had it not been for her traveling companions and my barbarian brothers. Since then, I have deliberately, yet regretfully, done what I could to ensure our paths would not cross again. I knew now that her love for me was gone forever. I also knew that should she press a fight, I would triumph. The thought of her dying was bad enough. For her death to be by my blade was unforgivable, unthinkable.

I am 190 years old.

I am 4’ 3” tall and weigh 50 lbs.


Headed northeast along the northern edge of the Dunrocks
Met up with the barbarian clan that ended up taking him in
They were battling some wild orcs, so I drew my short sword and dashed in to help
Was wounded, slashed across the face, but he did manage to take down an orc and assisted on a couple of others
the clan was impressed with his zeal
